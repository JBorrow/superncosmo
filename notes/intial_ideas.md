Possible plans for the future
=============================

Idea 1: Write own simulation
----------------------------

Could write my own simulation to test out formation models.
Would definitely have to be dark matter only for two reasons: computation time and my own ability.
This would be incredibly difficult and I don't even know if I would be able to run a large enough simulation to have meaningful results.

Idea 2: Combine WMAP/Planck maybe/T1a/etc... data to pin down models
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Look at chi square fit statistics to find which is the best fit.
Or could use the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo approach.
Find lots of different models

Idea 3: Compare simulation data with real data
----------------------------------------------

Would be able to see which is the most effective model for formation/evolution of the Universe.
Then could fit that model.
However, pretty much all large scale simulations use $\Lambda$CDM, which isn't really that interesting.
Therefore, see idea 1.
However it could still be interesting to look at metallicity of galaxies, how it is similar between Illisturis and EAGLE.
But I don't knwo how well that fits with the initial problem.
