Presentation
============

Format: 7 mins; 3 mins for questions afterwards.
Should present work so far and ideas for the future.

Should I investigate tension between the PLANCK, BAO and SN1a datsets? That could be fun. Well, 'fun'.

Outline
-------

First three minutes talk about using more supernovae (larger dataset) rather than just relying on the like 60 that we have.

Should talk about how SN1a actually work, like what makes them have an intrinsic luminosity?

Because we can exploit this to see if there should be any undiscovered L(z).

Talk about tenions in current datasets, show figures with huge systematics from SN1a.
