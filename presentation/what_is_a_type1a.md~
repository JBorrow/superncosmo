What is a type 1a Supernova?
============================

Occurs in binary systems with one of the stars a white dwarf.
The other star can be pretty much anything.

Carbon-Oxygen WDs with a low rate of rotation are limited to below 1.38 Msun.
At higher masses, they re-ignite and can trigger a supernova explosion.
This limit is often reffered to as the Chandrasekhar mass despite being slightly different from the Chandresakar limit.

They produce a consistent peak luminisoty because of the uniform mass given by the Chandresakar mass.
Empirical evidance that a white dwarf is the progenitor of a SN1a only came in 2014 from M82.

Peak luminosity is regulated b Ni56 decay
